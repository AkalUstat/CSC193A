        <h1>Assignment 2: Tabla Knowledge</h1>
        <p>
            This is my page. We're now adding some text about a topic that I
            find very interesting: <strong>tabla</strong> (North Indian drums).
            Now, I don't know Western-style drumming to compare to but I find
            the Taala system well-suited to me. We have a very rigid beat
            structure and groove, and all improvization happens
            <strong>within</strong> that structure. For example, we have one of
            the first taalas that a student will learn: Teentaal. Teentaal is a
            16-beat cycle, broken down into four sections of four beats. The
            First, Second, and Fourth sections start with an emphasized note
            (called a Taali) and the Third is unemphasized (called Khali). All
            traditional compositions - Kaidas (a
            <strong>long-form</strong> composition that develops a certain
            syllable) and Tukras (<strong>shorter</strong>, more energetic
            compositions to accent a vocalist) among others - adhere to the
            structure of Teentaal, and improvize within that constraint. For
            more detail, you can look at
